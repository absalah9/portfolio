      <h3>Mechanic</h3>
      <p class="mechanic-skill-description">During my high school years I was fascinated with cars (still am!); I even an extracurricular class called "Collision Repair".
        As the name hints to it; the task was to repair broken down cars. And then I went on to get a job working on vehicles.
        Started changing tires and then went on to repair vehicles on my own.

      <h3>Web and Mobile Developer</h3>
      <p class="code-skill-description">Cars weren't my only love growing up. I had this idea as a child that I'd grow up to work on computers all day long. When I was 15 I had a friend who was very
      invested in learning all things regarding computers. He tried to teach me about binary numbers, but after the first day of it I decided this field wasn't for me.
      11 years later; I decide to give it another try, because I still very much loved electronics. Only this time I wanted to first learn about web and mobile developing.</p>

      <h3>Electronic trouble shooting</h3>
      <p class="ts-skill-description">Given my love for most things electronics; I grew up being one of the go to people in my family with any troubleshooting issues regarding their devices.
        Fixing people's devices for them piqued my curiousity in how most electronics are made. Since I was interested in how the electronics were made this just spurred me on to
      learn how to develop it myself.</p>
